These are projection services that I wrote that listen to an item stream 
in order to fill tables I made in the Oracle database. There was a user 
table that stored all users and an item overview table that stored the 
item data. Other projection services that I created but not included in 
the portfolio is the ItemEventHistoryProjection, UserEventHistoryProject,
ShelfLifeProjection, DailyCountProjection, and PlansProjection. All these
projections were written in the C# programming languange.
